# Portfolio Website

My personal website using Next.js, React, and Express for the front-end and using the WordPress CMS as the backend.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Dependency Installation

To install everything needed for the project, run `npm install --save next react react-dom express` in terminal.

The above command will install Next.js, React, and Express

### Running the build

Once everything is installed you can run the development build process for the project with `npm run dev`. This will start a local server at http://localhost:8080/ with the site.
